FDTD Simulation Run Notes
==========================

This document summarizes the key simulation settings used in the finite-difference 
time-domain (FDTD) simulations reported in the associated Materials Advances manuscript.


Software
--------
ANSYS Lumerical FDTD Solutions


Simulation File
---------------
- File type: .fsp (Lumerical FDTD project file)
- The .fsp file contains the complete simulation setup, including geometry, sources, 
  monitors, mesh settings, and boundary conditions.


Simulation Type
---------------
3D FDTD simulation of a perovskite light-emitting diode (PeLED) incorporating a 
plasmonic nanostructure for spontaneous emission enhancement and light extraction analysis.


Geometry Overview
-----------------
- Substrate and electrodes
- Electron transport layer (ETL)
- Perovskite emissive layer (CsSnₓGe₁₋ₓI₃)
- Hole transport layer (HTL)
- Plasmonic nanostructure positioned near the emissive region

The representative geometry is fully defined within the provided .fsp file.


Source Definition
-----------------
- Electric dipole source
- Emission wavelength range: Near-infrared (as reported in the manuscript)
- Dipole orientations: In-plane and out-of-plane configurations
- Dipole location: Within the perovskite emissive layer at a fixed distance from 
  the plasmonic structure


Boundary Conditions
-------------------
- Lateral directions: Periodic boundary conditions
- Vertical direction: Perfectly matched layers (PML)


Mesh Settings
-------------
- Non-uniform mesh
- Local mesh refinement applied around the plasmonic nanostructure
- Coarser mesh used in non-critical regions to reduce computational cost


Monitors
--------
- Power monitors for radiated power calculation
- Near-field monitors for electric field distribution
- Far-field projection monitor for light extraction efficiency (LEE)
- Normalization monitors for Purcell factor evaluation


Simulation Outputs
------------------
- Purcell enhancement factor
- Light extraction efficiency (LEE)
- Near-field electric field distributions
- Far-field radiation patterns


Notes
-----
- Raw field data and time-domain monitor outputs are not included in this repository 
  due to data size and software-specific constraints.
- The shared .fsp file represents a reproducible reference configuration illustrating 
  the simulation methodology used in this work.
- Additional information and data can be obtained from the corresponding author upon 
  reasonable request.
