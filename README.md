# FDTD Simulation File for Materials Advances Submission

This repository contains a representative finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation file associated with the manuscript:

**"An Integrated DFT–FDTD Design of Plasmon-Enhanced Lead-Free CsSnₓGe₁₋ₓI₃ Perovskite LEDs"**, submitted to *Materials Advances*.

---

## Contents

- A representative ANSYS Lumerical FDTD project file (`.fsp`) containing:
  - Perovskite LED layer stack
  - Plasmonic nanostructure geometry
  - Dipole source configuration
  - Optical monitors used for emission analysis

---

## Notes

- The provided `.fsp` file is intended to demonstrate the simulation methodology, geometry setup, and parameter choices used in the study.
- Raw time-domain field data and full simulation outputs are not included due to file size and software-specific constraints.
- Only a representative configuration is shared; additional compositions and parameter variations discussed in the manuscript are not included.
- Additional data may be obtained from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
